we read the image and store it in an input matrix of integers
copy the frame of the image to output matrix
apply the calculations to the inner pixels and store the result to the output matrix
write the output matrix to output file

The serial:
[usage] ./serial orignalImage mask outputImage
execution time is 0.04527

The parallel:
added '#pragma omp parallel for' to the serial code
compile with -fopenmp option
[usage] ./parallel orignalImage mask outputImage numThreads
the machine has 3 cores
time for 1 thread: 0.0464301
time for 2 thread: 0.047291
time for 3 thread: 0.0477049
time for 4 thread: 0.0458598

we notice that the time of the serial code is less than the time of parallel for all number of threads.
so the serial is faster than the parallel.

for parallel:
when incresed number of threads from 1 to 3 exection time increased. it got slower.
except for 4 threads which equals the number of cores it was faster than the parallel with single thread and slower than the serial.
